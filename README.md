# Kabal Fund

> Decentralized Community-Driven Trading Funds on Solana

Kabal Fund is a fully on-chain fund management protocol built on Solana, where users can create decentralized funds, contribute SOL deposits, and collaboratively govern trading strategies through Telegram-integrated voting. These funds are actively traded by fund managers via CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) calls to the Jupiter Aggregator, Solana's premier liquidity routing protocol.

## üß© Core Features

- **Create Funds**: Any user can create a new fund, which generates a unique fund ID and a dedicated Telegram group.
- **Deposit SOL**: Users can deposit SOL into any active fund for a fixed lock-up period.
- **Telegram-Based Voting**: Each fund has a corresponding Telegram group with an admin bot for governance.
- **Decentralized Polling**: Fund admins can initiate token selection polls via the Telegram bot.
- **Fund Governance**: Only contributors can vote on polls that determine trading strategies.
- **CPI Integration with Jupiter Aggregator**: Seamless execution of optimal token swaps from within the fund's smart contract.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This project consists of three main components:

- [Smart Contracts](./contracts/README.md) - Solana programs written in Rust using the Anchor framework
- [Backend Service](./backend/README.md) - Node.js/TypeScript server managing Telegram bot integration and data synchronization
- [Frontend Application](./frontend/README.md) - React application for fund management and user interactions
